This project focuses on building a neural network model to predict the fuel efficiency (miles per gallon, MPG) of automobiles based on their technical specifications.

## Project Description

The project uses the [Auto MPG Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data) from the UCI repository. The model is trained to predict the **MPG** value using the following features:
- Number of cylinders (Cylinders)
- Engine displacement (Displacement)
- Horsepower (Horsepower)
- Weight (Weight)
- Acceleration (Acceleration)
- Model year (Model Year)
- Origin (Origin)
